          I am a serial entrepreneur with experience starting and operating 5 businesses in the last 30 years. I love to learn! I started as a Sales Agent at American General Life and Accident Insurance Co. Then I took over R&S Computers. This was a VAR (value added resale) company focusing on computer hardware and solutions. This company’s focus was to research and provide turn-key and out of the box solutions to shipping companies world-wide. We were a Compaq service provider. This meant we were authorized for warranty repair of Compaq servers and systems. I became an MCSE (Microsoft Certified Software Engineer) for NT. This was a requirement to becoming a Compaq Engineer.{<br></br>}

          I Started DBRI Properties L.L.C. in 1998. This is a property holding company that’s focus was and still is to purchase properties to rent and hold to provide a housing solution. It taught me the systems to manage and operate within the housing rental markets.

          From there, I ran and operated the GlassDoctor of San Antonio L.L.C. This was a glass repair company that replaces or installs residential, industrial and auto glass. Although the industry was different then what I had previously done, I found that my skills from earlier businesses transferred very easily.

          Back issues forced me to change my focus. Loving the computer industry since I was very young it seemed the logical solution for my next work chapter. I am currently enrolled in UTSA’s software development bootcamp. I have found this to be so rewarding and fun. I love the satisfaction of completing a project. It has allowed me the challenge of learning new technologies and applying them to everyday problems. The best part, is that every day is a new challenge. I can’t wait to apply these skills to enable others to realize there business potential.
